## Project Objectives: 
The objectives of this project are to:
- Develop a model that accurately classifies tweets regarding 6 U.S. Airlines into positive, negative, and neutral classes
- Discern which text vectorization/ word embedding technique results in the best performance for each classifier

## Project Outcomes 
- Developed a logistic regression classifier using bag of words text vectorization that resulted in an average minority class recall of 73% and overall accuracy of 77%
- Developed a convolutional neural network using pre-trained GloVe word embeddings that resulted in an average minority recall of 68.3%
- Developed an LSTM neural network using pre-trained GloVe word embeddings that resulted in an average minority recall of 67.5%

## Understanding the Data

- This data was taken from Kaggleâ€™s Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset. 
- The dataset consists of 14,640 Twitter reviews of 6 various airlines. Each of the reviews is labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

As we can see there are far more instances of negative tweets than of positive and neutral tweets. We expect our classifier to best be able to detect negative tweets because it has the most instances of that class to learn from.

Among all airlines, the distribution of tweets across the classes is imbalanced. A majority of the reviews are negative.
